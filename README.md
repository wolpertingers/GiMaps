# :globe_with_meridians:  GiMaps

Maperitive script to style OpenStreetMap section with custom colors.

## Motivation

This is an alternative to [Mapiful](mapiful.com) and others, where you have to pay high amounts of money for a nice map. With *GiMaps* you can style your own map section in the desired colors, which you can then print as you wish.

## Usage

Copy folders `/Rules` and `/Scripts` into the *Maperitive* installation directory and from there run
```
Maperitive GiMaps/scripts/filderstadt.mscript
```
This will download the map from OpenStreetMap, apply the rules for styling and export the map as a SVG file.
